- `primary`
    - `engine` A Catbox engine of any kind.
    - `options` The options you want to pass to the engine.

### Examples

Basic usage, Redis with Memory as fallback.

```javascript
const server = Hapi.server({
    port: 3000,
    host: 'localhost',
    cache: {
        name: 'fallback',
        provider: {
            constructor: require('catbox-fallback'),
            options: {
                primary: {
                    engine: require('catbox-redis'),
                    options: {
                        partition: 'example',
                        host: '127.0.0.1',
                        port: 6379
                    },
                    timeout: 5000,
                    recoveryDelay: 30000
                },
                secondary: {
                    engine: require('catbox-memory')
                }
            }
        }
